sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: TODO
Upper boundary: 8.184 seconds (using random50000.txt)
Lower boundary: 0.397 seconds (using sorted50000.txt)
Therefore: O(n^2) and Ω(n)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: TODO
Upper boundary ≈ Lower boundary
Therefore it is either merge sort or selection sort
However when compared to boundaries of selection sort, sort2 completes in much shorter time
Therefore: Θ(nlogn)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: TODO
same as sort2
