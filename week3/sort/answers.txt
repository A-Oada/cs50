sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Upper boundary: 8.184 seconds (using random50000.txt), lower boundary: 0.397 seconds (using sorted50000.txt), therefore: O(n^2) and Ω(n)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Upper boundary ≈ Lower boundary therefore it is either merge sort or selection sort, however when compared to boundaries of selection sort, sort2 completes in much shorter time therefore: Θ(nlogn)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: same as sort2
